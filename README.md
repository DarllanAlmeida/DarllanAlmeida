## Hi there I'm Darllan 👋

Passionate about programming and learning new things. I am currently specialized in Java and SpringBoot, although I have experience in developing with HTML,CSS,Javascript and React. I have worked on projects using Spring Framework for the Backend and React for the Frontend. I love working in a team and contributing my part to the group.

So, if you're looking for someone who is detail-oriented, consistent, and highly curious about new technologies, feel free to send me a message.
